# Zuimio-Lab-Work

**所有的同学都辛苦了！！**

在即将进入大四的通知：此仓库clone次数接近200次（不是，暑假了怎么还有clone!草）。如果有帮上一部分同学的忙或者稍微节约同学的时间非常开心！
当然如果没帮上，就当我是自己为了记录w。
大四上必然是个艰难的时期，但是本人也将迎来一系列考试、面试、毕业设计等等工作，时间很紧迫，加上有些老师强硬的签到方式（eg.扫你码），
还有同学完全copy作业并上传。这都是大家都不想看到的，很遗憾将考虑削减提供的内容，可能大概也许会失去次仓库原有的功能。

最后祝大家都能找到自己的 Happy Way 并成功上岸，

*感谢陪伴！感谢陪伴！感谢陪伴！*

如果你也是 HDU&ITMO Automation **大三/四**的学生，那么此仓库中的作业可能也许大概会对你有所帮助，比如安排考研复习时间。
sm/文件夹下会存放MATLAB代码和模型。

* 请不要原封不动地把作业、代码或模型直接上交给老师！
* 碰到模型用不了请直接Issue, 或者私信。
* 值得注意的是某些课程要求课堂提交手写作业，那么本仓库不提供。

**本仓库中的作业不能保证获得满分，但能确保完成！**

*仅仅用于记录**我的**工作，分享**我的**想法。*

Great job, everyone! You've all worked really hard!!

As we're about to enter our senior year, I’d like to mention that this repository has been cloned nearly 200 times. If it has been helpful or saved you even a little time, I’m truly happy!
Of course, if it hasn’t been useful, just consider it my personal notes for the record 

The first semester of senior year is bound to be challenging. I, too, will be facing a series of exams, interviews, graduation projects, and more—time is tight.
Additionally, some classmates have completely copied assignments and re-uploaded them. This is something none of us want to see. Unfortunately, I may have to consider reducing the content shared here, and this repository might lose some of its original functionality.

Finally, I wish you guys can find your own Happy Way and succeed in reaching your goals.

*Thank you! Thank you!Thank you!*

If you are also a junior majoring in Automation at HDU & ITMO, the assignments in this repository might be helpful to you, such as scheduling time for postgraduate entrance exam preparation.

* Please do not hand in your homework, code or models to the teacher without any modification!
* If you encounter any issues with the models, please directly raise an issue or send a private message.
* It is worth noting that for some courses that require handwritten homework to be submitted in class, this repository does not provide such support.

**The assignments in this repository do not guarantee full marks, but they do ensure completion!**

*Recording my work and sharing my ideas.*
